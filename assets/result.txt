Make Me A Video Game!

I the loud and messy Karen have ran Jon's neat sister and plan to steal her interesting treats!

What are a tiger and backpacking kitten to do? Before you can help Jane, you'll have to collect the lovely meats and dying stores that open up the 7 worlds connected to A Bob Lair. There are 2 feasts and 6 tears in the game, along with hundreds of other goodies for you to find.
